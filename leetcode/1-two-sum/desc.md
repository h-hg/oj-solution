Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly** one solution, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**
